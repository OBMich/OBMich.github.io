				<h2>Consulting</h2><br>
		<p>When your budget is limited, and the need to make an impact is high, it is important to design for evaluation. Before you invest money and time, build a foundation for creating and evaluating the impact of your program. <br>
			Designing for evaluation does not have to be time-consuming or expensive. Understanding and documenting the social impact of your investments can go a long way in securing ongoing funding, recruiting qualified board members and staff, <br>
			and ensuring that your efforts make a real difference. 
		
		<p>I have professional experience consulting with the U.S. Air Force, and academic experience providing technical reports to a wide range of stakeholders.<br>
		In addition to designing and conducting program evaluation and analyses, I have presented findings and provided policy recommendations to improve services and further organizational missions.</p>
		
		

<p>Please use the links below to contact me for details. Not quite sure what you need or want? Reach out and I'm happy to consult with you about your specific goals.</p>
