		<h2>Public Engagement</h2>
		<br>I approach public engagement as a critical stage of the research process. In order for social research to have impact on policies and programs, the findings need to be translated for diverse audiences.<br>
		<p>I have presented research findings to such audiences as: internal stakeholders, policy-makers from the Department of Defense, the United Nations Development Programme, union workers preparing to meet their representatives, K-12 educators incorporating international perspectives in their curricula, and public audiences.

 <h2>Selected Evaluations:</h2> 
	<br>The following are excerpts from years of teaching undergraduate courses at the University of Washington. Full sets of student evaluations are available upon request.</br>
 <br>"I feel better equipped to analyze and critique data presented to me. I can better understand scholarly articles, both in their implications and limitations."
 <br>"Michelle's attitude and personality was awesome, a nice balance of Subject Matter Expert (formal) and Human (informal) communication style."
 <br>"Michelle taught an amazing class. Her expertise and witty style ultimately made the dark and grim study of war interesting and creative. She has a unique ability to boil down an incredibly dense subject so it can foster good discussion."
 <br>"Michelle organizes her lectures in a way that is clear and easy to follow. She is always willing to answer any and all questions and she keeps the information relevant and interesting."
