		<h2>Teaching Statement:</h2>
		<p>Just as in my scholarly research I strive to examine questions of structural forces underlying social change and demographic outcomes, my primary teaching goal is to develop students' ability to recognize and examine these forces in their every day experiences. Each course I teach begins with objectives for student learning that reflect their need for skills that carry forward through advanced Sociology coursework as well as their early careers. Not all undergraduates will become graduate students, and so their tasks in my courses are oriented toward becoming sophisticated and critical readers of social research, toward becoming effective analytical thinkers in their early careers, and toward being able to effectively convey information to non-technical audiences.</p>
