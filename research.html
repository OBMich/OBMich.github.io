		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<p>Political Conflict, Migration, Demography, Quantitative Methods</p>
   
		<h2>The Long-Term Social Consequences of War</h2>
   <p>This research focuses on how institutions and individuals interact to produce long-term social change. 
	   Some of this research draws on field experience in Tajikistan in 2017, to examine changes to social institutions such as education and migration in the aftermath of war. 
	   I take two approaches to this work: first, I understand conflict to be an event-based phenomenon that occurs locally, and second, I understand conflict to affect individual outcomes as well as the institutional landscape.
	  My analyses include large survey data analysis, simulation modeling, and qualitative analysis of original interview data. </p>
	   
	   <h2>Theorizing Violence and Migration</h2>
		<p> This research focuses on creating a new conceptual framework to understand the causal relationship between violence and migration. 
			Critiquing the influence of the 1951 Refugee Convention on researchers' reliance on administrative categories and the data produced for policy making, 
			I propose a theoretical construct, "violence-motivated migration" that focuses on specifying how, when, and why violence drives migration. </p>
		
		<h2>Preferred Statistical Programming Languages</h2>
		<p>R, advanced; Stata, advanced; Python, intermediate</p>
