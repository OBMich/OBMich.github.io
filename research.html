		<h2>The Long-Term Social Consequences of War and Genocide</h2>
   <p>This research focuses on how institutions and individuals interact to produce long-term social change. 
	   Some of this research draws on field experience in Tajikistan in 2017, to examine changes to social institutions such as education and migration in the aftermath of war. 
	   I take two approaches to this work: first, I understand conflict to be an event-based phenomenon that occurs locally, and second, I understand conflict to affect individual outcomes as well as the institutional landscape.
	  My analyses include large survey data analysis, simulation modeling, and qualitative analysis of original interview data. </p>

		<h2>Violence and Migration</h2>
		<p> This research focuses understanding the causal relationship between wartime and nonwartime violence and migration. 
			I focus on specifying how, when, and why violence shapes migration. </p>
