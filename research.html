		<p>How does violence affect the way that people make decisions? My work examines how the experience of violence changes the way people migrate, have babies, and send their children to school. </ br> 
		These questions are simple, but how we answer them has to be complex - between authoritarian post-conflict settings to trauma, examining the effect of violence requires creative strategies. 
			In my work, I typically combine data sources and methods. Large-scale statistical modeling can be paired with computational simulation - such as in a survey-initialized agent-based model, or with in-depth fieldwork like focus groups and interviews, in order to explore nuanced dimensions of human decision-making.

	<b><p style="font-size:160%;">Long-term Consequences of War and Armed Conflict</p></b>
   <p>This research focuses on how institutions and individuals interact to produce long-term social change. 
	   Some of this research draws on field experience in Tajikistan in 2017, to examine changes to social institutions such as education and migration in the aftermath of war. 
	   I take two approaches to this work: first, I understand conflict to be an event-based phenomenon that occurs locally, and second, I understand conflict to affect individual outcomes as well as the institutional landscape.
	  My analyses include large survey data analysis, simulation modeling, and qualitative analysis of original interview data. </p>
